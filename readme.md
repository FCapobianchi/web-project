Requirements
------------

- Web Project for Nette 3.1 requires installed on your computer:
	[Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
	[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com))
	PHP >=7.4
	MySQL


Installation
------------

From your command line:

	composer create-project fcapobianchi/web-project path/to/install
	cd path/to/install
	composer update
	npm install
	npm start


Make directories `temp/` and `log/` writable.


Web Server Setup
----------------

The simplest way to get started is to start the built-in PHP server in the root directory of your project:

	php -S localhost:8000 -t www

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the welcome page.

For Apache or Nginx, setup a virtual host to point to the `www/` directory of the project and you
should be ready to go.

**It is CRITICAL that whole `app/`, `config/`, `log/` and `temp/` directories are not accessible directly
via a web browser. See [security warning](https://nette.org/security-warning).**
